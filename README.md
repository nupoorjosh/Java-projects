## Senior Year Thesis: Academic Assessment System for KJSCE Autonomy   (June 2016-May 2017)

### Managed a team of 4 for the mobile app development on Android Platform which includes the following steps:
* Ideation: As student empowerment was the theme we chose, we interviewed 8 different student personas to understand their pain points. And concluded that lack of clarity in understanding the grading system was common across
* Requirements Gathering – We conducted focused group workshops with 4 of the groups to further understand difficulty in understanding the grading system and collected the data points accordingly
* Solution Design – Designed the solution based on available technology, tools & data
* Performing Technical Tests – Tested the app for specific test cases
* Performed User Acceptance Tests(UAT) - Conducted user tests with a sample group of users
* Continuous Improvement – Added additional features based on the inputs of UAT.

### The app consists of the functionalities, addressing student pain points, which:
* Helps prioritize and plan for subjects with higher probability to score better. This enables students not only to choose the subjects of interest but also enables them to balance it with scores required.
* Forecasts future scores, which allows students to pre-gauge the additional efforts required. This functionality is implemented by using multiple linear regressions on the student’s current and previous performance
* Generates characteristic traits of the user by monitoring mobile activity for 30 days and maps it to the previous forecast results to predict more accurate future performance.
